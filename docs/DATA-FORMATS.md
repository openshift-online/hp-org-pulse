# Data File Formats

This document describes the JSON structure of all files stored in the `data/` directory (production)
and `fixtures/` directory (demo mode).
**Demo fixtures must always match production format** — see [Fixture Rules](#fixture-rules) below.

## Agentic Bug Refinement — `bug-refinement/data.json`

The HP Automation module's Refine page caches issues matching
`project IN (OCPBUGS, CNTRLPLANE) AND labels = "refined-by-agent"`, ordered by
Jira's `updated` field descending. All Jira statuses are included. The home page's
**Agentic Bug Refinement** card opens `#/hp-automation/refine`.

```

`GET /api/modules/hp-automation/refine/data` returns this snapshot plus the
configured `jiraHost`, a `jiraSearchUrl` for the exact query, and a boolean `demo`
flag. A missing snapshot triggers an initial Jira fetch. The
registered `hp-automation:refine-refresh` refresh job and admin-only
`POST /api/modules/hp-automation/refine/refresh` replace the snapshot after
a successful fetch. Concurrent refreshes share one fetch; failures preserve the
previous snapshot. Demo mode reads `fixtures/bug-refinement/data.json`
without Jira requests or writes. The view marks these issues as fictional examples
and omits individual Jira issue links. The search link always opens the real Jira
query using the viewer's Jira login. Export anonymizes issue keys, summaries, and
assignees.

Chai's refine workflow adds `refined-by-agent` for every saved disposition:
`DEFER`, `SOLVE`, `NEEDS_INFO`, `NEED_HUMAN_ANALYSIS`, and `CLOSE`. The label does not mean
the issue is solved or ready for implementation. The view shows `needs-info`
and `need-human-analysis` as waiting labels. Dispositions come from the newest
visible saved comment containing `[refine:v1] outcome=...`, never from labels or
Jira status. Comments are fetched newest first using the paginated
[Jira comments API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issue-comments/#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueidorkey-comment-get),
including older pages if the assessment is no longer among recent comments.
Both plain text and Atlassian Document Format comment bodies are supported.
`disposition` is one of the five values above, or `null` (displayed as **Unknown**)
when no recognized assessment is visible. An unrecognized newer outcome does not
fall back to an older assessment. `dispositionAt` is the assessment comment's
creation timestamp; `dispositionCommentId` links the badge to the source comment.
These fields may be `null`; comment bodies are not persisted, and comment authors are kept only as
`timeline` actors.
`CLOSE` records an explicit closure assessment; it does not imply that a fix was
implemented or verified. When an issue is `Closed` and has neither a disposition
nor assessment comment metadata, the view displays **CLOSE (Jira)**, with a tooltip
identifying Jira status as the source. These issues contribute to Close counters
and sort with `CLOSE`. This display fallback does not change the persisted
disposition or claim a saved assessment or verified fix. Explicit saved
dispositions take precedence; an unrecognized assessment with comment metadata
remains **Unknown**. Other statuses without saved assessments remain **Unknown**.
Old snapshots without disposition fields use this same Jira closure fallback
until refreshed.
Snapshots fetched before `CLOSE` was supported also need a refresh to recognize
those saved assessments.
`updated` is the last Jira update, not the refinement time.
`assignee` and `updated` may be `null`; missing status or priority is `Unknown`.

Each refresh also searches the same label scope with `status WAS POST` and
`status WAS MODIFIED`, requesting only the status field. `prPosted` is `true`
when the issue was ever in POST (a pull request was linked) or MODIFIED, or when
`pullRequests` is not empty: a linked pull request whose bug check fails
(`jira/invalid-bug`) never moves the issue to POST. `merged` is `true` when it
was ever in MODIFIED (the pull request merged), so later ON_QA, Verified, or Closed
transitions keep the outcome. These flags follow the OCPBUGS lifecycle and do not
identify who authored the pull request; CNTRLPLANE issues do not use these statuses,
so `merged` stays `false` and `prPosted` is `true` only for a linked pull request. `backports` lists
the clones named by `jlp-<branch>:<KEY>` labels on the original issue, in label
order. Clones inherit `refined-by-agent`, so each entry copies the clone's
`status`, `prPosted`, and `merged` from the same snapshot; all three are `null` when
the clone is not in the snapshot. Snapshots fetched before `prPosted` was copied omit
it, and the view then treats a clone in POST as having a pull request. The HP Automation module serves this snapshot unchanged from
`GET /api/modules/hp-automation/pipeline/data` for its **Bug Pipeline** view at
`#/hp-automation/pipeline`. Snapshots fetched before these fields existed omit them, and
that view asks for a refresh instead of reporting zero merges. `pullRequests` lists the GitHub pull requests in
the [Jira remote links](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issue-remote-links/#api-rest-api-3-issue-issueidorkey-remotelink-get)
of issues with a `SOLVE` disposition and of backport clones named by `jlp-` labels,
fetched with one request per issue during refresh; it is empty for other issues. Each entry keeps the canonical pull request
`url`, its `repo` (`org/name`), and `number`; remote link titles are not stored.
Merge state comes from the issue's `merged` flag, not from the links. Export also
anonymizes backport keys, including the keys inside `jlp-` labels, and replaces
`pullRequests` with an empty list because the links identify the real issue.

`created` and `reporter` come from the issue's Jira fields; `reporter` is a display
name or `null`. `timeline` lists the issue's workflow decisions oldest first. Each
entry has a `type`, an ISO `at` timestamp, and `by`, the display name of the Jira
account that made the change (or `null`):

- `assessment`: every saved `[refine:v1] outcome=...` comment, with `outcome` (one of
  the five dispositions, or `null` when unrecognized) and `commentId`. Comments are read
  through every page so that re-assessments are kept; the newest still sets `disposition`.
- `status`: every status transition, with the `from` and `to` status names.
- `label`: additions (`added: true`) and removals (`added: false`) of `issue-for-agent`
  (the Jira Solve Agent's intake label), `needs-info`, `need-human-analysis`, and
  `jlp-<branch>:<KEY>` backport labels, with the `label`. Other labels are ignored.

Status and label changes come from the
[bulk changelog API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-issues/#api-rest-api-3-changelog-bulkfetch-post),
one request per 1000 issues filtered to the `status` and `labels` fields and following
`nextPageToken`; its epoch-millisecond timestamps are stored as ISO strings. Bots appear
under their Jira account names, and Chai's assessments under the account that saved
them. Export anonymizes `reporter`, every timeline `by`, and the keys inside timeline
backport labels. Snapshots fetched before these fields existed omit them; the pipeline
view then omits the first-assessment column and timings, and each bug's flow asks for
a refresh.

## Person Metrics — `data/people/{name}.json`

Filename is the person's display name lowercased with non-alphanumeric chars replaced by `_`.

```json
{
  "jiraDisplayName": "Alice Smith",
  "jiraAccountId": "5e41b8c03df51b0c937390ec",
  "fetchedAt": "2026-03-27T06:02:05.213Z",
  "lookbackDays": 365,
  "resolved": {
    "count": 54,
    "storyPoints": 139,
    "issues": [
      {
        "key": "PROJ-1234",
        "summary": "Fix login bug",
        "status": "Resolved",
        "resolution": "Done",
        "storyPoints": 3,
        "resolutionDate": "2026-03-26T18:40:28.603+0000",
        "cycleTimeDays": 4.5
      }
    ]
  },
  "inProgress": {
    "count": 1,
    "storyPoints": 1,
    "issues": [
      {
        "key": "PROJ-5678",
        "summary": "Add feature",
        "status": "In Progress",
        "storyPoints": 1,
        "resolutionDate": null
      }
    ]
  },
  "cycleTime": {
    "avgDays": 8.6,
    "medianDays": 2.4
  }
}
```

**Notes:**

- `resolution` is the Jira resolution name (e.g., `"Done"`, `"Fixed"`) or `null` for unresolved issues.
  Issues with no-work resolutions (`"Won't Do"`, `"Obsolete"`, `"Duplicate"`, `"Cannot Reproduce"`)
  are excluded from resolved metrics at fetch time.
- `resolutionDate` uses ISO 8601 with timezone offset (e.g., `"2026-02-26T08:23:28.000+0000"`),
  NOT simple `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `lookbackDays` is currently 365 for most users but may vary
- `cycleTimeDays` on individual issues can be fractional

## GitHub Contributions — `data/github-contributions.json`

```json
{
  "users": {
    "username": {
      "totalContributions": 215,
      "months": {
        "2025-03": 11,
        "2025-04": 6,
        "2026-01": 27
      },
      "fetchedAt": "2026-03-27T06:03:48.669Z",
      "username": "username"
    }
  }
}
```

## GitHub History — `data/github-history.json`

```json
{
  "users": {
    "username": {
      "months": {
        "2025-03": 11,
        "2025-04": 6,
        "2026-01": 27
      },
      "fetchedAt": "2026-03-27T06:03:48.669Z"
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Monthly data is nested under a `months` key, NOT flat on the user object.

## GitLab Contributions — `data/gitlab-contributions.json`

```json
{
  "users": {
    "username": {
      "totalContributions": 42,
      "months": {
        "2025-12": 10,
        "2026-01": 15
      },
      "fetchedAt": "2026-03-27T06:01:19.791Z",
      "source": "graphql",
      "username": "username",
      "instances": [
        { "baseUrl": "https://gitlab.com", "label": "GitLab.com", "contributions": 20 },
        { "baseUrl": "https://gitlab.internal.example.com", "label": "Internal", "contributions": 22 }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## GitLab History — `data/gitlab-history.json`

```json
{
  "users": {
    "username": {
      "months": {
        "2025-12": 10,
        "2026-01": 15
      },
      "fetchedAt": "2026-03-27T06:01:19.791Z"
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Same nested `months` structure as GitHub history.

**Note on `source` field:** In `gitlab-contributions.json`, the `source` field indicates the API
used to fetch the data. Currently the only value is `"graphql"` (GitLab GraphQL API).

**Note on `instances` field:** When multi-instance GitLab is configured, each user's entry includes
an `instances` array showing per-instance contribution breakdowns. Users with no contributions on
a given instance will not have that instance listed. Legacy data without `instances` is treated
as a single default gitlab.com instance by the frontend.

## Site Config — `data/site-config.json`

Platform-level configuration for the site. Created when an admin saves settings in Settings > General.

```json
{
  "titlePrefix": "HP Engineering",
  "authEmailDomain": "cluster.local"
}
```

**Notes:**

- `titlePrefix` is a string (max 100 characters). When non-empty, it's shown as a subtitle
  in the sidebar and prepended to the page title.
- `authEmailDomain` is a string (max 253 characters, valid RFC 1123 domain). When set,
  role assignments normalize emails to this domain so that LDAP-provided emails (e.g. `user@redhat.com`)
  match OAuth proxy emails (e.g. `user@cluster.local`). Can also be set via the `AUTH_EMAIL_DOMAIN` env var,
  which takes precedence.
- If this file doesn't exist, both fields default to `""` (empty string).

## Landing Page Config — `data/landing-page-config.json`

Administrator-selected landing page block configuration. Created when an admin selects a block in Settings > Landing Page.

```json
{
  "activeBlock": "team-tracker:organization-overview"
}
```

**Notes:**

- `activeBlock` is a module-qualified block ID (`"moduleSlug:blockId"`) or `null` if no block is selected.
- When `null` or the file does not exist, the landing page renders without a block (existing behavior).
- If the referenced module is disabled or removed, the block is silently omitted at render time.

## Messages — `data/messages.json`

Admin-created announcements stored as a JSON array. Merged with computed provider messages at `GET /api/messages`.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "admin:1717200000000",
    "type": "info",
    "text": "Scheduled maintenance on Saturday 10 AM - 12 PM UTC.",
    "link": {
      "label": "Details",
      "href": "https://status.example.com"
    }
  }
]
```

**Notes:**

- `id` is auto-generated as `admin:<timestamp>` on creation.
- `type` is one of: `"warning"`, `"info"`, `"error"`. Determines banner color in the UI.
- `text` is a plain-text string (no HTML or markdown).
- `link` is either `null` or an object with non-empty `label` and `href` strings. `href` must be an
  `http(s)://` or `#` URL (no `javascript:` or `data:` URIs).
- Created on first `POST /api/admin/messages`. Lives in the PVC-mounted `data/` directory.
- No update API — to change a message, delete and re-create it.

## Roster Sync Config — `data/team-data/config.json`

Stores the consolidated configuration for automated roster building (merged from the former
`roster-sync-config.json` and IPA config). Managed via the Settings UI and the
`POST /api/admin/roster-sync/config` endpoint.

```json
{
  "orgRoots": [
    { "uid": "jsmith", "displayName": "Jane Smith" }
  ],
  "googleSheetId": "1ABCdef...",
  "sheetNames": ["Sheet1", "Sheet2"],
  "githubOrgs": ["my-org"],
  "gitlabGroups": ["my-group"],
  "gitlabInstances": [
    {
      "label": "GitLab.com",
      "baseUrl": "https://gitlab.com",
      "tokenEnvVar": "GITLAB_TOKEN",
      "groups": ["my-group"],
      "excludeGroups": ["redhat/rhel-ai/core/mirrors"]
    }
  ],
  "teamStructure": {
    "nameColumn": "Name",
    "teamGroupingColumn": "Team",
    "customFields": [
      {
        "key": "focus_area",
        "columnLabel": "Focus Area",
        "displayLabel": "Focus Area",
        "visible": true,
        "primaryDisplay": false
      }
    ]
  },
  "teamDataSource": "sheets",
  "gracePeriodDays": 30,
  "autoSync": { "enabled": false, "intervalHours": 24 },
  "lastSyncAt": "2026-03-27T06:00:00.000Z",
  "lastSyncStatus": "success",
  "lastSyncError": null,
  "ldapFields": {
    "discovered": ["rhatRnDComponent", "rhatSubproduct", "rhatJobRole"],
    "discoveredAt": "2026-06-18T12:00:00.000Z",
    "enabled": [
      { "attribute": "rhatRnDComponent", "label": "Business Unit" }
    ]
  },
  "_migratedFrom": "roster-sync-config.json"
}
```

**Notes:**

- `orgRoots` is required (at least one). Each entry needs `uid` and `displayName`. UIDs must match `/^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$/`.
- `googleSheetId`, `sheetNames`, `githubOrgs`, `gitlabGroups`, `gitlabInstances` are optional (default to `null` or `[]`).
- `gitlabInstances` is the preferred way to configure GitLab instances. Legacy `gitlabGroups` is auto-migrated to
  `gitlabInstances` on first load. Each instance has `label`, `baseUrl` (must start with `https://`), `tokenEnvVar`
  (name of env var holding the token), `groups` (array of group paths), and optional `excludeGroups`
  (array of group paths to skip when fetching contributions, e.g., mirror repositories).
- `teamStructure` replaces legacy `fieldMapping`/`customFields` via an in-memory migration on load.
- `customFields` supports up to 20 entries. At most one can have `primaryDisplay: true`.
- `gracePeriodDays` controls how long inactive people are retained before purging (default 30).
- `autoSync` controls the automatic sync scheduler (default disabled).
- `lastSyncAt`, `lastSyncStatus`, `lastSyncError` are auto-populated during sync runs.
- `teamDataSource` controls where team structure data lives: `"sheets"` (default, Google Sheets enrichment)
  or `"in-app"` (managed via the Team Structure Management UI). When `"in-app"`,
  Sheets Phase 2 enrichment is skipped during sync.
- `ldapFields` configures admin-managed LDAP attribute discovery and sync. `discovered` is the cached list
  of all available LDAP attributes from the last schema query (populated via `POST /api/admin/roster-sync/ldap-discover`).
  `enabled` is the admin-selected subset with display labels (max 20). Attributes already in the hardcoded base set
  (`LDAP_ATTRS`) are rejected. Empty or missing `ldapFields` means no extra LDAP attributes are synced (backward compatible).
- `_migratedFrom` is set to `"roster-sync-config.json"` after one-time migration from the legacy config file.
  The old file is never deleted (rollback safety net).

## Sync Log — `data/team-data/sync-log.json`

Written after each consolidated sync run. Contains the result of the most recent sync.

```json
{
  "completedAt": "2026-03-27T06:00:12.345Z",
  "status": "success",
  "duration": 12345,
  "stats": {
    "totalPeople": 42,
    "active": 40,
    "inactive": 2,
    "newlyAdded": 3,
    "reactivated": 0,
    "changed": 5,
    "sheetsEnriched": 38,
    "githubInferred": 2,
    "gitlabInferred": 1
  },
  "coverage": { "github": 0.85, "gitlab": 0.78 }
}
```

**Notes:**

- On error, the log contains `status: "error"`, `message`, `duration`, and `completedAt` — no `stats` or `coverage`.
- Overwritten on each sync run (not appended).

## Module State — `data/modules-state.json`

Tracks which modules are enabled or disabled. Managed via `POST /api/admin/modules/:slug/enable` and `POST /api/admin/modules/:slug/disable`.

```json
{
  "team-tracker": true,
  "hello": false
}
```

**Notes:**

- Keys are module slugs, values are booleans.
- An empty object `{}` is valid — modules fall back to their `defaultEnabled` value from `module.json`.
- Created on first module enable/disable action; may not exist on fresh deployments.
- At startup, required dependencies are auto-enabled via `reconcileStartupState()`.

## Snapshots — `data/snapshots/{sanitized-teamKey}/{YYYY-MM-DD}.json`

Team key is sanitized: `::` becomes `--`, special chars become `_`. The filename date is the period end date.

```json
{
  "periodStart": "2026-01-01",
  "periodEnd": "2026-02-01",
  "generatedAt": "2026-03-26T15:19:47.360Z",
  "team": {
    "resolvedCount": 42,
    "resolvedPoints": 85,
    "avgCycleTimeDays": 4.2,
    "githubContributions": 350,
    "gitlabContributions": 120
  },
  "members": {
    "Alice Smith": {
      "resolvedCount": 10,
      "resolvedPoints": 25,
      "avgCycleTimeDays": 3.5,
      "githubContributions": 72,
      "gitlabContributions": 18,
      "hasGithub": true,
      "hasGitlab": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Jira Name Map — `data/jira-name-map.json`

```json
{
  "Alice Smith": {
    "accountId": "5e41b8c03df51b0c937390ec",
    "displayName": "Alice Smith"
  }
}
```

## People Registry — `data/team-data/registry.json`

The single source of truth for all people data. Built by the consolidated sync pipeline
(`shared/server/roster-sync/consolidated-sync.js`) which combines LDAP traversal, Google Sheets enrichment,
username inference, and lifecycle tracking.

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "generatedAt": "2026-03-27T06:00:00.000Z",
    "provider": "ipa",
    "orgRoots": ["jsmith"],
    "vp": { "name": "VP Name", "uid": "vpuid" }
  },
  "people": {
    "jsmith": {
      "uid": "jsmith",
      "name": "Jane Smith",
      "email": "jsmith@example.com",
      "title": "Engineering Manager",
      "managerUid": "vpuid",

      "ldapExtra": { "rhatRnDComponent": "Enablement", "rhatSubproduct": "Red Hat OpenShift AI" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Notes:**

- `people` is a flat `{ uid: person }` map with structured `github`/`gitlab` fields and lifecycle tracking
  (`status`, `firstSeenAt`, `lastSeenAt`, `inactiveSince`).
- `orgType` is `"engineering"` (default) or `"auxiliary"` for non-engineering people (e.g., product managers, designers).
  Entries without `orgType` are treated as `"engineering"` for backward compatibility.
- `orgRoot` for auxiliary people uses the sentinel value `"_auxiliary"`. This keeps them out of the engineering org
  tree while satisfying the `orgRoot` field requirement.
- Auxiliary people are excluded from GitHub/GitLab coverage statistics (`computeCoverage()`) and from the legacy roster
  shape (`readRosterFull()` filters out the `_auxiliary` org bucket).
- `readRosterFull()` in `shared/server/roster.js` transforms this into the legacy
  `{ orgs: { key: { leader, members } } }` format for backward compatibility with `deriveRoster()` and downstream consumers.
- Leaders are identified by matching a person's `uid` against the configured `orgRoots[].uid` values.
- Enrichment fields from Google Sheets (`_teamGrouping`, `specialty`, `jiraTeam`, etc.) are stored as top-level fields
  on person records.
- `teamIds` is an array of team IDs (e.g., `["team_a1b2c3"]`) linking the person to in-app managed teams.
  Defaults to `[]`. Only used when `teamDataSource` is `"in-app"`.
- `_appFields` is an object mapping field definition IDs to values. Values are strings for single-value fields,
  or arrays of strings for multi-value fields (e.g., `{ "field_x1y2z3": "backend", "field_mv0001": ["Python", "Go"] }`).
  Stores person-level custom field values managed in-app. The `_` prefix ensures it is not overwritten
  by Sheets enrichment during sync.
- `ldapExtra` is an optional object containing admin-enabled LDAP attributes beyond the hardcoded base set.
  Keys are LDAP attribute names (e.g., `rhatRnDComponent`), values are strings or arrays for multi-value attributes.
  Only present when admin has enabled extra LDAP fields via Settings > LDAP Fields. Populated during roster sync;
  cleared when all extra fields are disabled.

**Derived roster API response (`GET /api/roster`):**

- When multiple org roots share the same explicitly-configured `displayName` in config,
  `deriveRoster()` merges them into a single org entry.
- The merged org's `key` is the alphabetically-first root UID among the merged roots.
- Merged orgs include a `mergedKeys` array (sorted alphabetically) listing all root UIDs that were combined.
- Non-merged orgs do not have a `mergedKeys` field.

## Allowlist — `data/allowlist.json`

```json
["user1@example.com", "user2@example.com"]
```

## Teams — `data/team-data/teams.json`

Stores all in-app managed teams. Created when `teamDataSource` is set to `"in-app"` and teams are created
via the Team Structure Management UI or migration.

```json
{
  "teams": {
    "team_a1b2c3": {
      "id": "team_a1b2c3",
      "name": "Platform",
      "orgKey": "achen",
      "createdAt": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "createdBy": "admin@example.com",
      "description": "Owns the **core platform services** and developer experience.",
      "managers": ["bsmith"],
      "metadata": {
        "field_g7h8i9": "Pat Manager"
      },
      "boards": [
        { "url": "https://redhat.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/RHOAIENG/boards/1103", "name": "RHOAIENG - Platform" },
        { "url": "https://redhat.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/RHOAIENG/boards/1200", "name": "" }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Notes:**

- `teams` is a `{ teamId: team }` map.
- Team IDs follow the pattern `team_` + 6 hex characters (e.g., `team_a1b2c3`), generated via `crypto.randomBytes(3)`.
- `orgKey` links the team to an org root UID.
- `description` is an optional Markdown string (max 2000 chars) describing the team's mission or scope.
  `null` when not set.
- `managers` is an array of UIDs identifying the explicit managers of this team. Used for team-level permissions
  (purview, membership, fields, boards). Defaults to `[]`.
- `metadata` stores team-level custom field values, keyed by field definition ID.
  Empty object `{}` when no team fields are set.
- `createdBy` is the email of the user who created the team.
- `boards` is an array of `{ url, name }` objects representing user-managed Jira board links.
  `url` is required (non-empty string), `name` is optional (empty string means no display name set).
  Defaults to `[]` on new teams. Populated during Sheets-to-In-App migration from `teams-metadata.json` board data.

**Note:** Sprint tracking boards (`sprint-data/teams.json`) and team record boards (`team-data/teams.json[].boards`)
are separate data stores with different lifecycles. Sprint tracking boards are auto-discovered from Jira
and include sprint-specific metadata (filters, staleness). Team record boards are user-managed URLs.
A future enhancement may link these two systems.

## Allocation Data — provided by an extension

Work allocation is no longer part of core. It ships as a consumer-repo
`platform/` contribution (see [`docs/PLATFORM.md`](PLATFORM.md) § Team-Tracker
Contributions), which owns its own storage schema under a `data/allocation/`
prefix. The allocation data-format reference lives with that extension in the
consumer repo, not here. Core writes no allocation data.

## Field Definitions — `data/team-data/field-definitions.json`

Stores custom field definitions for person-level and team-level fields. Created when `teamDataSource`
is set to `"in-app"` and fields are defined via the Field Definitions UI or migration.

```json
{
  "personFields": [
    {
      "id": "field_x1y2z3",
      "label": "Focus Area",
      "type": "free-text",
      "multiValue": false,
      "required": false,
      "visible": true,
      "primaryDisplay": true,
      "helpText": "The primary area this person is currently focused on.",
      "allowedValues": null,
      "optionsRef": null,
      "deleted": false,
      "order": 0,
      "createdAt": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "createdBy": "admin@example.com"
    }
  ],
  "teamFields": [
    {
      "id": "field_g7h8i9",
      "label": "Product Manager",
      "type": "person-reference-linked",
      "multiValue": false,
      "required": false,
      "visible": true,
      "primaryDisplay": false,
      "helpText": null,
      "allowedValues": null,
      "optionsRef": null,
      "deleted": false,
      "order": 0,
      "createdAt": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "createdBy": "admin@example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Notes:**

- `personFields` and `teamFields` are arrays sorted by `order`.
- Field IDs follow the pattern `field_` + 6 hex characters (e.g., `field_x1y2z3`).
- `type` is one of: `"free-text"`, `"constrained"`, `"person-reference-linked"`.
- `multiValue` is a boolean. When `true`, the field accepts an array of values.
  Valid for all field types (`constrained`, `free-text`, `person-reference-linked`). Defaults to `false`.
- `deleted` supports soft-delete — deleted fields are hidden from the UI but values are preserved.
- `allowedValues` is an array of strings for `constrained` fields (the set of selectable options),
  or `null` for other field types. Maximum 100 items, each up to 200 characters. When `optionsRef` is set,
  `allowedValues` is `null` in storage and resolved at runtime from the referenced field option set.
- `optionsRef` is an optional string referencing a named field option set (e.g., `"components"`).
  When set, the field's allowed values are sourced dynamically from `data/team-data/field-options/<optionsRef>.json`
  instead of from the static `allowedValues` array. The `GET /structure/field-definitions` API response resolves
  `optionsRef` fields by injecting the option values into `allowedValues` (with a `_resolvedFromOptions: true` flag).
  Defaults to `null`.
- `helpText` is an optional string (or `null`) providing guidance displayed to users via an info icon.
  Supports a minimal inline-markdown subset: `**bold**` and `[text](https://...)` links. Defaults to `null`.
- At most one person field can have `primaryDisplay: true`.

## Field Options — `data/team-data/field-options/<name>.json`

Each field option set is a separate JSON file, identified by name. Used by field definitions
with `optionsRef` to source allowed values dynamically.

```json
{
  "name": "components",
  "label": "Components",
  "values": [
    "Data Pipelines",
    "Infrastructure Services",
    "ML Models",
    "Platform Core",
    "Platform Dashboard"
  ],
  "updatedAt": "2026-04-29T12:00:00Z",
  "updatedBy": "admin@example.com",
  "migrationDone": true,
  "migratedAt": "2026-04-29T12:00:00Z",
  "migratedBy": "admin@example.com"
}
```

**Notes:**

- `name` is the stable identifier referenced by `optionsRef` on field definitions (e.g., `"components"`).
- `label` is the human-readable name shown in the Manage UI.
- `values` is an ordered array of valid entries. Maximum 500 items, each up to 200 characters.
  Values are deduplicated and sorted alphabetically on write.
- `updatedAt` and `updatedBy` track the last modification.
- `migrationDone`, `migratedAt`, `migratedBy` are set by the component model migration to prevent re-running.
  Only present on the "components" option set after migration.

## Field Exceptions — `data/team-data/field-exceptions.json`

Per-field exceptions that exclude specific fields from completeness checks for individual people
or teams. Centrally managed — expected volume is low (tens to hundreds).

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "exceptions": [
    {
      "id": "fex_a1b2c3d4",
      "entityType": "person",
      "entityId": "jsmith",
      "fieldId": "field_dept_id",
      "reason": "Contractor — department not applicable",
      "createdAt": "2026-05-20T14:00:00.000Z",
      "createdBy": "admin@example.com"
    },
    {
      "id": "fex_i9j0k1l2",
      "entityType": "team",
      "entityId": "team_def456",
      "fieldId": "__boards__",
      "reason": "Infrastructure team — no Jira boards",
      "createdAt": "2026-05-20T16:00:00.000Z",
      "createdBy": "admin@example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Notes:**

- `id` format: `fex_` prefix + 8 hex chars.
- `entityType` is `"person"` or `"team"`.
- `entityId` is a person UID (registry key) or team ID.
- `fieldId` references a field from `field-definitions.json`, or the reserved sentinel `__boards__`
  (valid only with `entityType: "team"`) for teams that intentionally have no Jira boards.
- Uniqueness: one exception per `(entityType, entityId, fieldId)` tuple. Duplicate creates update the reason (upsert).
- If the file does not exist, the system treats it as zero exceptions.
- Excepted fields are excluded from completeness counts in the message provider and Data Quality/Manager Dashboard UIs,
  but remain visible with an "Exception" badge.

## Audit Log — `data/audit-log.json`

Append-only log of team structure management actions. Entries are added by team, field, and migration operations.

```json
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "id": "evt_demo0001",
      "timestamp": "2026-01-15T10:00:00.000Z",
      "actor": "admin@example.com",
      "action": "team.create",
      "entityType": "team",
      "entityId": "team_a1b2c3",
      "entityLabel": "Platform",
      "field": null,
      "oldValue": null,
      "newValue": null,
      "detail": "Created team \"Platform\" in org achen"
    }
  ],
  "maxEntries": 10000
}
```

**Notes:**

- `entries` is ordered newest-first (prepended). Capped at `maxEntries` (10,000) — oldest entries are trimmed.
- `action` values include: `team.create`, `team.rename`, `team.delete`, `team.boards.update`,
  `person.team.assign`, `person.team.unassign`, `person.fields.update`, `team.fields.update`, `field.create`,
  `field.update`, `field.delete`, `field.reorder`, `migration.sheets_to_inapp`, `field-options.add`,
  `field-options.replace`, `field-options.remove`, `migration.field-to-options`, `field-exception.create`,
  `field-exception.update`, `field-exception.remove`.
- `entityType` is one of: `"team"`, `"person"`, `"field"`, `"system"`, `"field-options"`, `"field-exception"`, `"migration"`.
- `field`, `oldValue`, `newValue` are used for change-tracking (e.g., rename, field value updates). `null` when not applicable.
- `detail` is a human-readable summary of the action.

## API Tokens — `data/api-tokens.json`

Stores hashed API tokens for bearer-token authentication. Created on first token creation.

```json
{
  "tokens": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-v4",
      "name": "My CI script",
      "tokenHash": "sha256-hex-of-full-token",
      "tokenPrefix": "tt_a1b2c3d4",
      "ownerEmail": "user@redhat.com",
      "scopes": ["roster:read", "metrics:read"],
      "createdAt": "2026-04-03T12:00:00Z",
      "expiresAt": "2026-07-03T12:00:00Z",
      "lastUsedAt": "2026-04-03T14:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Notes:**

- Raw tokens are never stored — only SHA-256 hashes.
- `tokenPrefix` stores the first 11 characters (e.g., `tt_a1b2c3d4`) for identification.
- `scopes` controls which API endpoints the token can access. Values: an array of scope strings
  (e.g., `["roster:read", "metrics:write"]`), `["*"]` for wildcard full access, `[]` for no access
  (except `tokens:manage`), or `null` for legacy full access. Legacy tokens without a `scopes`
  field are treated as `null` (full access). `tokens:manage` is always implicitly granted.
- `expiresAt` is `null` for non-expiring tokens.
- `lastUsedAt` is `null` until first use, then updated (throttled to once per 60 seconds).

## Health Metrics — `data/health-metrics/`

### Usage Events — `data/health-metrics/events/YYYY-MM.jsonl`

JSON Lines format (one JSON object per line). Partitioned by month for efficient retention pruning.

```text
{"ts":"2026-05-11T15:30:00.000Z","page":"team-tracker::org-dashboard","email":"user@redhat.com","userType":"Backend","roles":["admin"]}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `ts` | ISO string | Timestamp of the page view |
| `page` | string | `moduleSlug::viewId` composite key |
| `email` | string | User email (for unique-user counting) |
| `userType` | string | Value from configured person field at event time, or `"unknown"` |
| `roles` | string[] | User's roles at event time (e.g., `["admin"]`, `["team-admin"]`, `[]`). Legacy events may have `permissionTier` string instead; the aggregator handles both formats. |

### Monthly Aggregates — `data/health-metrics/aggregates/YYYY-MM.json`

```json
{
  "month": "2026-05",
  "generatedAt": "2026-06-01T06:00:00.000Z",
  "pages": {
    "team-tracker::org-dashboard": {
      "views": 342,
      "uniqueUsers": 28,
      "byUserType": { "Backend": 12, "Frontend": 8, "unknown": 3 },
      "byRole": { "admin": 3, "team-admin": 2, "planning-manager": 5 },
      "byPermissionTier": { "admin": 3, "manager": 10, "user": 15 }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration — `data/health-metrics/config.json`

```json
{
  "userTypeFieldId": "field_rq0001",
  "retentionDays": 90
}
```

### Opt-Out List — `data/health-metrics/opted-out.json`

```json
{
  "emails": ["user-who-opted-out@redhat.com"]
}
```

## Tools — `data/agentic-tools/tools.json`

Admin-managed list of internal and external tool links. Array of tool objects.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "tool_1234567890_abcdef",
    "title": "Example Tool",
    "description": "What this tool does",
    "icon": "wrench",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "order": 0
  },
  {
    "id": "tool_coming_soon",
    "title": "Coming Soon",
    "description": "A tool under development",
    "icon": "sparkles",
    "url": "",
    "order": 1
  },
  {
    "id": "tool_internal_page",
    "title": "RFE Review",
    "description": "Open the in-app AI Impact RFE review page",
    "icon": "clipboard-list",
    "url": "#/ai-impact/rfe-review",
    "order": 2
  }
]
```

**Fields:**

- `id` (string, auto-generated): Unique identifier in format `tool_<timestamp>_<randomstring>` or custom ID on creation.
- `title` (string, required): Display name of the tool.
- `description` (string, required): Short description of what the tool does.
- `icon` (string, required): Kebab-case name of a Lucide icon from the allowed set
  (e.g. `wrench`, `hammer`, `bot`, `sparkles`). See `AVAILABLE_ICONS` in
  `modules/agentic-tools/client/icon-registry.js` for the full list. This registry is used by both
  the settings picker and the tool cards so configured icons render consistently.
- `url` (string, optional): External URL or internal site route. Use a hash route like
  `#/ai-impact/rfe-review` for an in-app destination; root-relative paths and absolute URLs on the
  current origin are also treated as internal. Internal links open in the current tab and show an
  "Internal" badge. Links to another origin open in a new tab and show "External". Leave an empty
  string to mark a tool as TBD (To Be Determined); its card renders without a clickable link and
  displays a "TBD" badge.
- `order` (integer, optional): Display order in the grid. Tools are sorted by this field (ascending).
  Default 0 on creation; auto-assigned to next available order if omitted on POST.

**Notes:**

- Created/updated via `POST /api/modules/agentic-tools/tools` and `PATCH /api/modules/agentic-tools/tools/:id` (admin-gated).
- Deleted via `DELETE /api/modules/agentic-tools/tools/:id` (admin-gated).
- Reordering is handled by updating the `order` field on affected tools via PATCH.
- In demo mode (`DEMO_MODE=true`), write operations return a success response but do not persist changes to storage.

## Agentic Backports — `data/backport-tracker/data.json`

Cached OCPBUGS issues labeled `chai-backport`. An issue is marked `merged` when Jira's
status history matches `status WAS MODIFIED`, so later transitions to ON_QA, VERIFIED,
or CLOSED do not lose the successful merge outcome.

```json
{
  "fetchedAt": "2026-09-16T08:00:00.000Z",
  "issues": [
    {
      "key": "OCPBUGS-61002",
      "summary": "Example merged Chai-driven backport",
      "status": "VERIFIED",
      "updated": "2026-09-16T06:00:00.000Z",
      "merged": true
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `fetchedAt` | ISO string | Time of the most recent successful Jira refresh |
| `issues` | object[] | OCPBUGS issues carrying the `chai-backport` label |
| `issues[].merged` | boolean | Whether the issue has ever transitioned through MODIFIED |

---

## Agentic Risk Assessment — `data/risk-assessment/data.json`

Per-repository counts of pull requests (any state) carrying each Chai risk assessment
label: `chai-risk-assessment/low`, `chai-risk-assessment/moderate`, and
`chai-risk-assessment/critical`. Chai applies exactly one label per PR, for its latest
commit. Totals and shares are not stored; `GET /api/modules/hp-automation/risk/data`
computes them from these counts.

```json
{
  "fetchedAt": "2026-11-10T08:00:00.000Z",
  "repos": [
    {
      "repo": "openshift/hypershift",
      "counts": { "low": 25, "moderate": 42, "critical": 11 }
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `fetchedAt` | ISO string | Time of the most recent successful GitHub refresh |
| `repos` | object[] | One entry per tracked repository, including repositories with no labeled PRs |
| `repos[].repo` | string | `owner/name` GitHub repository |
| `repos[].counts` | object | PR count per risk level: `low`, `moderate`, `critical` |

---

## CVE Triage — `data/cve-triage/data.json`

Cached Jira issues grouped by solution. ARC stores OCPBUGS issues labeled `arc:triaged`;
`resolved` is true when the issue also has `arc:complete`.
Sustaining Engineer CHAI stores Jira issues from any project labeled `chai-bot-analyzed`;
`resolved` is true when Jira places the issue in its Done status category.
OAPE CHAI stores Jira issues from any project labeled `ai-cve-analyzed`;
`resolved` is true when Jira places the issue in its Done status category.

```json
{
  "fetchedAt": "2026-09-11T08:00:00.000Z",
  "solutions": {
    "arc": [

## Jira Solve Agent — `data/jira-solve-agent/data.json`

Cached OpenShift Jira Solve Agent data with PR hydration and remote links.
Issues are tracked from Jira (labeled `issue-for-agent`), bot PRs from GitHub,
and linked PRs from Jira remote issue links. The module performs deduplication and
PR state hydration to provide a unified view of agent activity across both systems.

```json
{
  "fetchedAt": "2026-09-29T12:00:00.000Z",
  "issues": [
    {
      "key": "TRT-1001",
      "summary": "Example issue tracked by Jira Solve Agent",
      "status": "In Progress",

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `fetchedAt` | ISO string | Time of the most recent successful refresh |
| `issues` | object[] | Combined array of Jira issues, net-new-keyed PRs, and NO-JIRA rows |
| `issues[].key` | string | Jira issue key (e.g., `TRT-1001`) or `NO-JIRA` for keyless bot PRs |
| `issues[].agentState` | string | Agent state derived from Jira status: `new`, `ready-to-solve`, `in-progress`, `closed`, or `other` |
| `issues[].processed` | boolean | Whether the issue has been processed by the agent (has linked PRs or is closed) |
| `issues[].linkedPrs` | object[] | Array of linked PRs from Jira remote issue links (GitHub-for-Jira integration) |
| `linkedPrs[].state` | string | PR state from GitHub GraphQL API: `OPEN`, `MERGED`, `CLOSED`, or `UNKNOWN` |
| `linkedPrs[].team` | string | Team owning the repository, derived from `TEAM_REPOS` mapping |
| `prs` | object[] | Raw bot PR data from GitHub (all states, after backport filtering) |
| `prs[].jiraKey` | string | Jira key parsed from PR title or branch name, or null for keyless PRs |
| `combined` | array | Deduplication result: PRs overlapping with tracked Jira issues (diagnostic field) |

**Deduplication logic**: Bot PRs are deduplicated against Jira issues by matching the PR's `jiraKey` to an issue's `key`.
Overlapping PRs are already represented by their Jira issue. Net-new-keyed PRs
(Jira key exists but issue lacks `issue-for-agent` label) and keyless PRs (no Jira reference)
each become their own row in the `issues` array. A net-new ticket with bot PRs in several
repos therefore appears once per PR, each row carrying that PR's `prUrl`, `prState`, and `team`.

**PR state hydration**: Linked PRs from Jira remote issue links are hydrated with state from GitHub's GraphQL API
(MERGED, OPEN, CLOSED) to show merge status without requiring the PR to be opened by a tracked bot account.

## AI Impact — `data/ai-impact/`

The AI Impact module tracks AI adoption across the HP Engineering. It is the
only module here that writes more than one data file: ten in total, listed in
`modules/ai-impact/module.json` under `export.files`. Some are fetched from Jira and
GitLab by the module's own refresh handler; others are **pushed in** by external
pipelines, per the display-layer constraint in `AGENTS.md`.

| File | Purpose | Producer |
|------|---------|----------|
| `rfe-data.json` | RFE issues from Jira, with AI-involvement labels resolved | Module refresh (Jira) |
| `autofix-data.json` | Autofix-tagged issues and stage-funnel metrics | Module refresh (Jira) |
| `doc-data.json` | Documentation contribution issues and label events | Module refresh (Jira) |
| `doc-mr-kpi-data.json` | Internal docs merge-request quality KPIs | Module refresh (GitLab) |
| `component-onboarding-data.json` | Component onboarding status and target versions | Module refresh (Jira) |
| `assessments.json` | RFE quality assessments, keyed by issue | Pushed via bulk API |
| `test-plans.json` | Test plan reviews, keyed by feature | Pushed via bulk API |
| `decomposer.json` | Epic-decomposer pipeline snapshot | Pushed via bulk API |
| `features.json` | Feature reviews (legacy fallback store — see below) | Pushed via bulk API |
| `config.json` | Module configuration (no PII) | Admin UI |

### RFE Data — `data/ai-impact/rfe-data.json`

Cached RFE issues fetched from Jira. The module's primary data file.

```json
{
  "fetchedAt": "2026-03-30T12:00:00Z",
  "issues": [
    {
      "key": "RFE-1234",
      "summary": "Implement real-time collaboration features",
      "status": "In Progress",
      "priority": "High",
      "created": "2026-03-25T10:00:00Z",
      "createdLabelDate": "2026-03-26T14:30:00.000+0000",
      "revisedLabelDate": "2026-03-27T09:15:00.000+0000",
      "creator": "schen",
      "creatorDisplayName": "Sarah Chen",
      "components": ["Platform Core", "ML Models"],
      "labels": ["rfe-creator-auto-created", "rfe-creator-auto-revised", "customer-request"],
      "aiInvolvement": "both",
      "linkedFeature": {
        "key": "HPSTRAT-567",
        "summary": "Strat: Real-time collaboration",
        "status": "In Progress",
        "fixVersions": ["RHOAI 2.16"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `aiInvolvement` | string | One of `both`, `created`, `revised`, `none` — derived from exact label matching at fetch time |
| `createdLabelDate` | string \| null | ISO timestamp of the most recent changelog addition of the created label. Set only when `aiInvolvement` is `created` or `both`. Falls back to `created` if the label was present since issue creation. `null` when the label is absent |
| `revisedLabelDate` | string \| null | Same logic as `createdLabelDate`, for the revised label |
| `needsAttentionSince` | string \| null | ISO timestamp of the most recent changelog addition of `rfe-creator-needs-attention`. Lets the frontend age an item independently of pipeline run frequency |
| `rubricPassSince` | string \| null | Same, for `rfe-creator-autofix-rubric-pass` |
| `components` | array | Jira component names. Empty array if the issue has none |
| `linkedFeature` | object \| null | Resolved from Jira issue links (type `Cloners`, outward to the configured linked project) |
| `labels` | array | Raw Jira label array, preserved for reference |

The `GET /api/modules/ai-impact/rfe-data` endpoint returns computed metrics alongside
this issue list, including a `pipelineFriction` object (`needsAttentionPct`,
`feasibilityBlockedPct`, and their period-over-period change and trend). The
denominator is AI-touched RFEs only (`aiInvolvement !== 'none'`) within the selected
window; trends are classified against `trendThresholdPp` from `config.json`.

---

### Jira Autofix — `data/ai-impact/autofix-data.json`

The Autofix snapshot keeps the `issues` pipeline-labeled cohort and adds
`policyEligibleIssues`, the gross Bug cohort returned by a separate policy query. The
gross query excludes CVE summary or label markers and embargoed issues; it does *not*
exclude closed status or mutable opt-out labels. `currentPolicyEligibleIssues` is a
separate current non-excluded snapshot that removes current `no-autofix`,
`auto-created` and `CVE` labels — a diagnostic snapshot, not a historical eligibility
denominator.

`metrics.stageFunnel` reports eligible, analyzed, PR proposed, PR merged, abandonment
and conversions. Its `authoritative` flag is true only when canonical immutable events
from the AIPCC-31384 Autofix outcome contract are available; Jira label and Forge-link
fallbacks are explicitly non-authoritative. `metrics.pipelineCohort` carries the
label-derived cohort counts that back the priority and effort charts.

---

### Feature Decomposer — `data/ai-impact/decomposer.json`

Epic-decomposition results pushed from the **epic-decomposer pipeline**
(`gitlab.com/redhat/rhel-ai/agentic-ci/epic-decomposer-results` →
`epic-decomposer-dashboard`). The dashboard's `generate-dashboard.py` emits a canonical
`data.json` that feeds both the GitLab-Pages dashboard and Org Pulse. The pipeline
pushes the **whole** `data.json` as a single-document snapshot per run (not a per-item
bulk array); Org Pulse validates the envelope leniently (`runs` array, `strategies`
object, `aggregates` object; extra fields tolerated) and stores a **subset** — dropping
`epic_bodies`, per-run `results`, per-epic signal maps and strategy `labels`, while
keeping `aggregates`, slim `runs`, `mermaid_dag` and slim `epics[]` for the expandable
strategy rows.

```json
{
  "lastSyncedAt": "2026-07-24T21:21:48.739Z",
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "generatedAt": "2026-07-24T00:00:00Z",
  "source": { "data_dir": "…" },
  "signalNames": ["…"],
  "investigationSignalNames": ["…"],
  "counts": { "runs": 9, "strategies": 25 },
  "aggregates": { "…": "verbatim from data.json" },
  "runs": [
    { "run_id": "…", "started": "…", "completed": "…", "duration_minutes": 10.7,
      "total": 2, "passed": 2, "failed": 0, "errors": 0, "avg_score": 14,
      "score_max": 14, "submitted_epics": 9 }
  ],
  "strategies": [
    { "strat_id": "HPSTRAT-1", "title": "…", "priority": "Major",
      "epic_count": 4, "critical_path_length": 3, "revised": true,
      "mermaid_dag": "graph TD…",
      "review": { "score": 14, "pass": true, "recommendation": "accept" },
      "epics": [
        { "epic_id": "HPSTRAT-1-E001", "title": "…", "type": "Implementation",
          "implementation_type": "standard", "priority": "P0", "component": "MLflow",
          "ai_implementability": "High", "jira_key": "RHAI-137", "dependencies": [] }
      ],
      "run_history": [{ "run_id": "…", "score": 14, "status": "passed", "epic_count": 2 }] }
  ]
}
```

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/modules/ai-impact/decomposer` | `ai-impact:read` | Snapshot for the Feature Decomposer view (adds `jiraHost`) |
| `GET` | `/api/modules/ai-impact/decomposer/status` | admin, `ai-impact:read` | `{ lastSyncedAt, generatedAt, counts }` |
| `POST` | `/api/modules/ai-impact/decomposer` | admin, `ai-impact:write` | Push the canonical `data.json`; stores the projected subset. No-op in demo mode |
| `DELETE` | `/api/modules/ai-impact/decomposer` | admin, `ai-impact:write` | Clears the snapshot (writes the empty skeleton, never `null`) |

**Notes:**
- The decomposer store is self-contained in `ai-impact`; decomposition results are an
  AI-Impact-only concern.
- KPI tiles and distribution charts render straight from the pre-computed `aggregates`
  — Org Pulse does no re-aggregation (display-layer only). The "Showing" date filter
  scopes the strategy list and volume-by-run trend; the `aggregates`-backed cards remain
  all-time.
- `mermaid_dag` is rendered client-side by `MermaidDiagram.vue`, which lazy-loads
  `mermaid`.

---

### Config — `data/ai-impact/config.json`

Admin-configurable settings for the module.

```json
{
  "jiraProject": "RFE",
  "linkedProject": "HPSTRAT",
  "createdLabel": "rfe-creator-auto-created",
  "revisedLabel": "rfe-creator-auto-revised",
  "testExclusionLabel": "rfe-creator-skill-testing",
  "linkTypeName": "Cloners",
  "excludedStatuses": ["Closed"],
  "lookbackMonths": 12,
  "trendThresholdPp": 2
}
```

**Notes:**
- All string fields are validated against JQL injection (no quotes, parens, semicolons,
  backslashes)
- `lookbackMonths` must be an integer between 1 and 120
- `trendThresholdPp` (0–50) is the percentage-point threshold for classifying trends as
  growing or declining
- Defaults are used when no config file exists

---

### Remaining AI Impact files

All five share the same envelope convention: a sync timestamp, a count, and a map keyed
by Jira issue key (or a flat array for the fetched-issue files). See the corresponding
fixture in `fixtures/ai-impact/` for a complete worked example.

| File | Top-level keys |
|------|----------------|
| `assessments.json` | `lastSyncedAt`, `totalAssessed`, `assessments` (map keyed by RFE key) |
| `test-plans.json` | `lastSyncedAt`, `lastJiraSyncAt`, `totalTestPlans`, `testPlans` (map keyed by feature key) |
| `doc-data.json` | `fetchedAt`, `cumulativeStats`, `issues[]`, `labelEvents[]` |
| `doc-mr-kpi-data.json` | `fetchedAt`, `mergeRequests[]` (GitLab MR metadata: `iid`, `state`, `mergedAt`, `commitCount`, `firstReviewAt`, …) |
| `component-onboarding-data.json` | `fetchedAt`, `totalComponents`, `components` (map keyed by onboarding issue key) |

`doc-mr-kpi-data.json` is populated only when the optional
`GITLAB_CEE_REDHAT_DOCS_TOKEN` module secret is set. Without it the fetch is skipped and
the Documentation view renders its other panels normally.

#### `features.json` — legacy fallback store

`server/features/storage.js` prefers the unified store at
`releases/execution/index.json` and `releases/execution/features/{KEY}.json`, falling
back to `ai-impact/features.json` and then to an empty result. **The `releases` module is
not deployed in this repository**, so the fallback is always what Feature Review reads
(shape: `lastSyncedAt`, `totalFeatures`, `features` keyed by feature key).

For the same reason the feature-ingest routes — `POST /features/bulk`,
`PUT /features/:key` and `DELETE /features` — forward to the releases execution API on
localhost and will return `502` until that module lands. These are admin-only write
endpoints; every read path degrades cleanly without them.

---

## Fixture Rules

The `fixtures/` directory provides read-only demo data used when `DEMO_MODE=true`.
These rules prevent data format drift:

1. **Fixtures must match production JSON structure.** When the backend changes how it writes a data file,
   update the corresponding fixture to use the same shape.
1. **Test mocks should match production format.** Unit test mock data (e.g., in `__tests__/`)
   should use the production JSON structure as the primary format. Add separate backward-compatibility
   tests if old formats need to be supported.
1. **Verify against real data.** If you're unsure of a data file's format, check the actual files in `data/`
   (symlinked from the main worktree) rather than trusting fixtures alone.

# HP Cyborg snapshot schema

The HP/Fleet exporter publishes Core's v1 complete-roster snapshot at
`team-data/cyborg/enrichment.json`. The contract is owned and validated by
`@org-pulse/core` 2.0.90; HP does not fork or extend its fields.

The `people` field is an array of records with required `uid` and `teams`
fields. An empty `teams` array represents a direct scope member without a
descendant-team assignment. The exporter validates the whole candidate before
writing and prints only aggregate status and counts. Snapshot files contain
person-level data and must be written only to an approved destination.
